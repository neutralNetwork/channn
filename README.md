(Neural Network communicating over Go Channels)

This is a proof of concept project for creating neural networks that are connected via Go channels.

The advantages are:

- arbitrary network architecture (see the [adder perceptron](https://github.com/neutralNetwork/channn/blob/sigmoid-neuron/examples/perceptron.go)).
- train and evaluate on multiple cores.

See the [`examples`](https://github.com/neutralNetwork/channn/tree/sigmoid-neuron/examples).
